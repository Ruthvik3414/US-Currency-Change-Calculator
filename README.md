# US-Currency-Change-Calculator
This C++ program efficiently calculates change for a given amount of cents. It uses a greedy algorithm to determine the optimal number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. By prioritizing the largest denominations, the program ensures the change is provided with the fewest possible coins.
